# ft_linear_regression
This project is about creating simple machine learing model in form of regression line to make predictions of a car price depending on the milage. The first program trains the model by finding the optimal slope and intercept of the regression using the gradient descent algorithm. The second program uses that trained model to make a prediction.

## Training the model with gradient descent
The training involves finding the regression line which fits the given training data the best, meaning that the squared sum of the errors made is at its minimum. This minimum is found by using the gradient descent algorithm. The regression line is described by $estimated_price(km) = Θ_0 + Θ_1 * km$
